This component is a generic Mark.
The component itself does not render anything visible.
It is useful to position an arbitrary child component based on geographich coordinates.
Like all `MapElements` it can only be used as a child of `MapLayout`.
That is why its children need to be `svg` nodes as well.

The indicated coordinates (longitude and latitude) presents the origin (top left) of its child node.
The origin is indicated by the <svg style={{display: "inline"}} width="10" height="10" viewBox="-5 -5 10 10"><LocationPin /></svg> in the stories.

## Non-centered Mark

<Canvas of={MarkStories.DefaultMark} />

## Centered Mark

The Mark's child node needs to take care of eventual repositioning (usually centering). The reposition can be achieved by applying a `transform` to the child node.

<Source
  code={`
  <Mark {...props} />
  <rect
    height={10}
    width={10}
    // ðŸ‘‰ the transform positions the drawn element at the coordinate origin
    transform="rotate(45) translate(-5 -5)"
  />
  `}
/>

This repositioning strategy is applied in the following story.

<Canvas of={MarkStories.RotatedMark} />
