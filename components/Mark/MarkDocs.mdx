This component is a generic Mark.
The component itself does not render anything visible.
It is useful to position an arbitrary child component based on geographich coordinates.
Like all `MapElements` it can only be used as a child of `MapLayout`.
That is why its children need to be `svg` nodes as well.

The indicated coordinates (longitude and latitude) presents the origin (top left) of its child node.
The origin is indicated by the <svg width="10" height="10" viewBox="-5 -5 10 10"><LocationPin /></svg> in the stories.
The Mark's child node needs to take care of eventual repositioning (usually centering).

## Non-centered Mark

<Canvas of={MarkStories.DefaultMark} />

## Centered Mark

<Canvas of={MarkStories.RotatedMark} />
