# ITC Atlas

The atlas maps ITC's history and contemporary efforts towards capacity development around the globe.
One aim of this project is to explore ways of streamlining the so far usually decoupled processes of publishing print and online atlases.

## About

The component library for the hybrid ITC atlas includes components aimed for print and online publishing.
