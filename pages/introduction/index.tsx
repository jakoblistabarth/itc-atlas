              The last decade the thematic focus was more consistent, but the
              geographic focus continues to shift, reflecting political choices.
              Development cooperation is seen as bilateral cooperation among
              stakeholders. From the Dutch side the national government works
              with societal partners such as ngoâ€™s, knowledge institutions, and
              the private sector.
