        <Paragraph>
          Through professional engagement with partners in the focus countries,
          often via educational and/or research cooperation, ITC can support the
          functioning of those parties, and at the same time incorporate
          experiences gained in its knowledge base to be reapplied at a later
          stage.

        <Paragraph>
          This section starts with the activities of ITC in Indonesia to
          demonstrate how over time the external technological, societal and
          political context has influenced how ITC and its Indonesian partners
          have worked together. This is followed by a global spatial and
          temporal overview of all ITC projects executed since the 1990s.
